# CODELAB 01: HotBlue

Our client **Hotblue** asked us to build a review system for their web shop. 
Today they already have a complete webshop in production.
The CEO of **Hotblue** strongly believes having customers reviewing and commenting on catalogue items is 
going to be the future.

When announcing his dream of a new review system he made the following statements

- All customers should be able to review all products
- A review exists of a rating (1-5), a one sentence summary and a textual description
- A customer should be able to delete his own reviews
- A customer can comment on his own reviews or on others reviews
- A product specialist (A **Hotblue** employee) can comment on reviews as well
- A customer can like or dislike a review
- A site visitor can consult reviews of products

## Your job

1. Create a Use Case Diagram for the product review system
2. Create an  Activity diagram (or multiple) for the product review system
3. Create a Class diagram for the product review system
4. Implement the Class diagram and the relations

## Solutions
We provided solutions for all the diagrams. 
Only take a look at them if you think you're completely finished, not if you're stuck...
Don't go sneak peeking!
