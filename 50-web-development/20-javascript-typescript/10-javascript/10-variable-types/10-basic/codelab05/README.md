# codelab04 - Constants

Just like in java you can define constants. 
Use `const` instead of `let` to make a variable constant

- Create a variable constant foo and give it value 5.
- Create a non-constant variable bar and give it value 3.
- Try changing the value of foo
- Try changing the value of bar
