    In javascript you can save values into variables.

    Unlike type-safe languages a variable in javascript doesn't have a type.
    Meaning that you can save whatever you want in every variable.

    However values do have types. The different value type or data types that exist are:

    - number
    - string
    - boolean
    - array
    - object
    - function
    - undefined

    Let's start with strings. Like with every datatype there are different ways of writing them.
    You can write a string with single quotes ', double " or backticks `

    Assign the following text to each variable in the correct format: Your bill is ${23 + 25}
    */
    const twentyThree = 23;
    const twentyFive = 25;

    let singleQuoteString = 'Your bill is ' + (twentyThree + twentyFive);
    let doubleQuoteString = "Your bill is " + (twentyThree + twentyFive);
    let backtickString = `Your bill is ${twentyThree + twentyFive}`;

    document.getElementById('single-quotes-output').innerHTML = singleQuoteString;
    document.getElementById('double-quotes-output').innerHTML = doubleQuoteString;
    document.getElementById('backticks-output').innerHTML = backtickString;
