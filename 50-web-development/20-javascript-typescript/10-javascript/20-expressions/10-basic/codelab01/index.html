    /*
        In javascript most expression work exactly the same as with java.
        One key difference is that you can build expressions with variables of different types.
        Which sometimes can lead to strange results.

        Try to think what the result of the following expressions will be and then try them out:
        - 50 * false
        - "hello" + true
        - "hello" / false
        - "50" - 5
        - "50" + 5
        - true && 1
        - false && 1
        - true == 1
        - true != 1
        - true !== 1
        - true === 1
        - true + true
        - true + true == 2
        - true + true === 2

        These things happen because of type coercion and this is the main reason you should avoid combining different data types in an expression.
        A more in depth explanation you can find on https://dev.to/neutrino2211/avoiding-weird-javascript-behaviour-true--true--2-but-true--1-pn9.

        The main thing you should remember is to always use === instead of == to compare values.
