    /*
        Yet another difference between java and javascript is that in javascript functions are objects, or in other words
        functions can always be used as variables and arguments.

        This opens a whole new world of possibilities!

        Let's start with a function declaration here aptly named declaration.
        - call the declaration function after it has been defined. (on any line lower than the definition)
        - call the declaration function before it has been defined.

        Now do the same for a function that has been defined as an expression and then assigned to a variable named expression.
        - call the expression function after it has been defined. (on any line lower than the definition)
        - call the expression function before it has been defined.

        Now let's use our functions as arguments
        - call the functionExecutor with the declaration function as argument
        - call the functionExecutor with the expression function as argument
        - call the functionExecutor with an inline function. That function should log "I am an inline function"
    */
    declaration();

    function declaration() {
        console.log('I am a declaration');
    }


    //expression();

    let expression = function () {
        console.log('I am an expression');
    };

    functionExecutor(declaration);
    functionExecutor(expression);
    functionExecutor(function () {console.log('I am an inline function')});

    function functionExecutor(anotherFunction) {
        anotherFunction();
    }

</script>
