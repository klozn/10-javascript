    /*
        Another notable way that javascript is different than java is the variable scope.

        Every variable lives in a scope.
        Here it will keep living happily until that scope is gone.
        At that point the variable will be removed.

        There are two types of scopes. The global scope and the functional scope.

        The global scope is the simplest one.
        Whenever you define a variable directly in the script tag it will reside in the global scope.
        Since the global scope never will be deleted, variables defined here will always be accessible.

        Exercise:
        - define an increaseCounter function that will increase a counter variable with one
        - define a decreaseCounter function that will decrease that same counter variable with one
     */
    let counter = 0;
    const updateResult = () => document.getElementById('result').innerText = counter.toString();

    function increaseCounter() {
        counter++;
        updateResult();
    }
    function decreaseCounter() {
        counter--;
        updateResult();
    }
