       Advanced exercise

       In javascript functions are variables meaning they too have a scope.
       This also means that you can define functions in functions (and other functions in those functions, and so on...).

       Variables defined in a parent function can also be accessed from the child function.
       Same with functions, a function can be called from its scope or any of it's child scopes.
       However a parent can not access the scope of it's children.

       Since we start from the global scope, you can always access all variables and functions defined there.

       Also variables and functions can be overwritten. Where the variable in the child scope takes precedence over the one in the parent.

       Exercise:
       - Given the scopes of functionA, functionB and functionC. Which sayXXX functions can be called from which scope and what is going to be the result?
           - You can call/not call following functions from the scope of functionA:
                - sayHowDoYouDo - false
                - sayBye - true : 'Bye'
                - sayHello - false
                - sayGoodMorning - true : 'Goodmorning'
          - You can call/not call following functions from the scope of functionB:
                - sayHowDoYouDo - true : 'How do you do?'
                - sayBye - true : 'Bye but special'
                - sayHello - false
                - sayGoodMorning - true : 'Goodmorning'
          - You can call/not call following functions from the scope of functionC:
                - sayHowDoYouDo - false
                - sayBye - false
                - sayHello - true : 'Hallo'
                - sayGoodMorning - true : 'Goodmorning'

          Think of the solution first before trying it out!
