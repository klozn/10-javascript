       A variable in a function scope ceases to exist as soon as the function of that scopes has been executed.
       However if something is still referencing an element of this scope the scope is kept alive.

       We can use this principle to create private variables!
       If a function, let's call it the parent function, returns another function, let's call it the child function, then
       the scope of the parent function is kept alive as long as somebody is referencing the returned child function.

       So in

       function parent() {
            let someVariable;
            function child() {
                //doSomething with someVariable
            }
            return child;
       }
       let childReference = parent();

       the variable someVariable is kept alive! Nobody except childReference could access it, making it private.

       A common way to write this pattern shorter is as follows:

       let childReference = (function() {
            let someVariable;
            return function() {
              //doSomething with someVariable
            }
       })();

       This pattern is an IIFE (pronounced iffy) and is the go to way to create closures in javascript.


       Exercise:
       - Let's go back to a counter solution. This solution is unsafe because counter is defined in the global scope
       and anybody could modify or access it. Make the counter variable private using an IIFE.
     */

    let increaseCounter = (function () {
        let counter;
        return function () {
            if (counter === undefined) {
                counter = 0;
            }
            return ++counter;
        };
    })();


    //This should keep working without being changed
    console.log(increaseCounter());
    console.log(increaseCounter());
    console.log(increaseCounter());
