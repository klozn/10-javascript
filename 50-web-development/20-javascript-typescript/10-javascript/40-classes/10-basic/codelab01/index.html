        We've seen primitive types and complex types. The one thing we're still missing are classes!

        You can use following syntax to create a class in javascript:

        class ClassName {

            constructor(parameterName1, parameterName2, ...) {
                this.fieldName1 = parameterName1;
                this.fieldName2 = parameterName2;
            }

            function function1() {
                this.fieldName1;
                this.function2();
            }

            function function2() {

            }
        }

        Notice the following difference between java and javascript:
        - you don't have field definitions as your first lines. Instead a class field is defined in the constructor.
        - to access a field or another method you always need to use the this keyword.
        - the constructor is named constructor
        - you can have only one constructor per class

        To create an object from a class you just use the new keyword:

        let object = new ClassName(value1, value2);

        Exercise:
        - create a class Person with two fields: firstName and lastName
        - create a method greeting that will return 'Hello ' + firstName + lastName;
        - create two Person objects and log their greeting in the console.
