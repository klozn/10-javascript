        Advanced exercise:

        Let's go a bit deeper into how the class syntax works.
        Why? Well it may surprise you but javascript actually doesn't have any classes. *surprised noises*

        What is the class keyword then all about? Well, it's fake.
        If you write a class in javascript it gets transformed behind the scenes into some other code.

        The class syntax was made to make your life easier. It used to work in a different way.

        How do classes then work? Javascript uses something called prototypical inheritance.
        Every object has a hidden __proto__ property. This property points at the parent of your object.

        In javascript to create a class you:
        - Define a (class) object that has all the properties and methods you want in your class
        - Create a new object and let it inherit from your class object
        - Call a constructor function to initialize all your properties

        The common pattern to do this:
        - Define a constructor function that sets all properties. The constructor function has the name of your new class.
        - Add all the methods and properties for your new class to the "prototype" property. Notice that this is different from the __proto__ property.
        - use the new keyword to create object from your construction function
            - the new keyword will:
                - create a new empty object
                - links the __proto__ property of your new object to the prototype of your constructor
                - call the constructor function while binding 'this' to your new object
                - return the newly created object

        it looks something like this:

        function ClassName(parameter1, parameter2) {
            this.property1 = parameter1;
            this.property2 = parameter2
        }

        ClassName.prototype.function1 = function() {
            this.property1;
            this.function2();
        }

        ClassName.prototype.function2 = function() {
            this.property2;
        }

       let object = new ClassName(value1, value2);

       Exercise:
       Transform the following old style class to the new class syntax
     */

    class Person {

        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        sayHello() {
            console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
        }
    }

    let person = new Person('Jef');
    person.sayHello();
