    /*
        We've already seen how we can load multiple javascript files into our browser by adding additional <script> tags.
        There are however some downsides to this. Naming conflicts, no encapsulation, etc...

        A better system is to work with modules.
        With a module you decide which variables get exposed from your file and which don't.
        To activate modules don't forget to write 'type="module"' in your script tag.

        Inspect the aModule.js file. You'll see that it exposes two named variables and one default variable.

        To import a named variable write "import {variableName} from 'fileName.js'"
        To import a default variable write "import someName from 'fileName.js'"

        Exercise:
        - import the three variables from aModule.js and print them to the console.
        - import the Person class from person.js. Make a person object and call the sayHello() method.
        - define your own cat class in a separate cat.js file. import this class and use it.

        The convention is that each class in javascript is its own module.
     */

    import * as module from './aModule.js';

    console.log(module.default);
    console.log(module.somethingThatWillBeExposed);
    console.log(module.somethingElseThatWillBeExposed);

    import Person from "./person.js";
    let person = new Person('Frank');
    person.sayHello();

    import {Cat} from "./cat.js";
    let cat = new Cat;
    cat.sayHello();
</script>
