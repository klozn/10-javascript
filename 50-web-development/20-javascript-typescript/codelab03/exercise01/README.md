# Exercise 01 - Arrays

Using the `string` and `array`'s prototype functions, write a `function countNonVowelsIn(word)` that

- takes a string as parameter
- converts it to an array
- removes the vowels
- and finally counts how many characters are left

> (no, you can't just count the consonants or we'll throw an `An-Sophie` at your implementation)

**Tip:** You can do this with one method chain without any intermediate variables thanks to the built-in `string` and `array` methods!
