    /*
        Advanced exercise:

        Be careful with the this keyword. This always points to the current object.
        Which means that if:
        - you call this in the global scope, this is pointing to the global (window) object. ! The global object is not the same as the global scope!
        - if you call a function in the global scope and that function is using this, then that this is also pointing to the global object.
        - if an object has a function and that function is using this, then that this is pointing to that object if you call the function from it.

        You can also explicitly set the value of this by using the apply(), call() or bind() functions.

        Exercise:
        - Try to figure out what the following executions will print out and why.
     */

    //Execution 1
    let obj1 = {
        name: 'object 1', sayName: function () {
            console.log(this.name);
        }
    };
    obj1.sayName();


    //Execution 2
    let obj2 = {name: 'object 2', sayName: obj1.sayName};
    obj2.sayName();


    //Execution 3
    let sayName = obj1.sayName;
    window.name = 'global object';
    sayName();


    //Execution 4
    let obj3 = {
        name: 'object 3', sayName: (function () {
            let _this = this;
            return function () {
                console.log(_this.name)
            };
        })()
    };
    obj3.sayName();

    //Execution 5
    sayName.bind(obj1)();

    //Execution 6
    sayName.call(obj1);

    //Execution 7
    sayName.apply(obj1);
