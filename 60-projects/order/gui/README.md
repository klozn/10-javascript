# Örder GUI

![Order Logo](../order.png)

Good news! We're hired to develop the frontend of the Örder application!

As the backend, use an already existing implementation! We can provide you with one.
- Run the backend locally, you'll frontend (GUI) will have to call its REST endpoints.

**Remark 1**:
We have provided mock-ups to give you some inspiration. However, you are free to deviate from them. 

**Remark 2**:
You don't have to bother about authentication or authorization. However, if you like, you can implement it as well. 
You'll have to implement a registration and sign-in form / screen for this.

## Requirement 1: Item overview

We want to see an overview of all the items. 

The items should be shown in a grid layout as is a popular approach in web-shops.
